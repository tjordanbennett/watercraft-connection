Even on days that seem like there is no wind, small particles of water can spray into your camera and damage it. If you'd like to bring your phone or other devices to take photos/videos, there is a small compartment on the watercraft where you can store them. We recommend renting one of our waterproof bags and being very careful when bringing expensive tech out on the water. We are not liable for what happens if it is lost or damaged. Our instructor can also take some pictures of you, but please be sure to tip them!",
